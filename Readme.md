## Decription 

  

I am learning Laravel (PHP) programming for some time, so I made CMS Example in order to continue learning programming in practice.  

CMS stands for [Content Management System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system).  

If also in the learning phase, this example could help you with the similar project.   

  

  

CMS consists of Front page and Administration page. 

  

  

### [Front page](www.template.com): 

  

- Have implemented and modified to my needs, [Carousel](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/examples/carousel/) Bootstrap theme. 

- Text in jumbotron is synchronized with the carousel.  

- Laravel Localization (Language switcher) is implemented.   

- From this page, you can go to the [Subscription page](http://www.template.com/subscription), which will be used for the subscription to newsletter.  

Subscription functionality not applied yet. 

  

  

  

### [Administration page](http://www.template.com/admin/dashboard):   

  

- I have implemented [SB Admin 2](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/sb-admin-2) Bootstrap theme. 

- In order to access this page, you will need to login first.  

- Run php artisan db:seed in your terminal. Use then these credentials to log in: email"=>"admin@template.com","password"=>"AdminTemplate"

- After authentication, you will be redirected to the [Administration Home page](http://www.template.com/admin/dashboard).  

You can also access this page, from the link [Dashboard](http://www.template.com/admin/dashboard) in the left sidebar.  

- On the left side bar, there are links to 2 more active pages: Send Email and Map   

- You can use [Send Email](http://www.template.com/admin/mail) page to send emails.  

Below the Compose Emails section, you can see another section with the status of the emails (sent/not sent). 

- You can use [Map](http://www.template.com/admin/map) page to set the company name, address and Google maps location.
